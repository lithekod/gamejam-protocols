# Future forms
Use multiple-choise text questions about good or bad things + other instead of just numbers
Don't ask questions about things on later days to people who showed up to  

# Information in the beginning
Discuss things to say in a metting before the jam
Mention food,
mention half time presentation, tell people that it is optional

# Checkin
Prepare things in advance
hand out notes for theme generation when people arrive

# Pizza order
Card reader was very useful. Better system for writing down peoples orders

# Group generation
Tables for ideas didn't work. Pizzas arrived during group formation. Survey says people enjoyed the group generation.
No good solution right now



# Half time review
Most people seemed to like it

# Sushi ordering
Order less shrimp pieces
If the menu works, chose different packages instead of ordering a specific number
More vegetarian pieces because not everyone wants only non-vegetarian

# Thai food ordering
Order a bit more than 3 dishes for 4 people. 
Casseroles were a good idea
More fried chicken, or tell people to not take more than 1
Add more rice
Add fried noodles

# Sunday food ordering
find a good place to order from in advance
People actually ate the food


# Ending and play testing
Most people enjoyed it

It's hard to play other peoples games and show yours off at the same time

Google slides was a good solution

Make the google slide into a continuous slideshow while people are playing


# Workshops
## Nilwen workshop
Someone should have contacted the person more than a week before the lecture.
We should also make sure we have access to the lecture room without having to run around and find someone at IDA.

# Demographics
Facebook marketing is very useful

# Other feedback
SOMEONE WANTED VEGETABLE SNACKS
Someone wanted the group creation process to be more structured

# Additional tings
Set up a discord or slack server to share links or ask everyone at the jam things.
