Speed dating. Frågor som ""

#Date
We have booked 5-7 maj, the lower floor is booked by someone else on the saturday. 
Erik will contact creactive and ask what event that is.
12-14 maj är SOF.


#Pizza order
Orders should be done at  7:00 instead of 6

We could do a pizzabufé. Creactive might not have enough plates for that


#Adult gamejam
Ikshu and Kevin can look into an adult jam during the summer.

#Ny lokal
Someone has to go look at the new location.


#Lectures
When we have dates, we could look around for people that could host lectures.

We could do python again, perhaps in a different library. Perhaps unreal instead 
of unity (perhaps someone from the game awards could do something)
Jesper knows someone who makes a javascript gamejam learning tool.


#Half time review
Lots of people liked the "walk-around-system" however it depends on how many 
people are there.


#Marketing
We want to do some posters and use facebook ads.
Also talk to other student associations.


#Responsibilities
We could have subgroops with different responsibilities and have weekly progress 
report meetings.



#Things to do until next meeting
Decide on the location and date at first. Start working on posters and advertisement.
Figgure out if and what what lectures we want and can host.
